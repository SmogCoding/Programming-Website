        <h2>What is Programming</h2>
      </header>

      <p>
        A computer is useless without you, and without software written by programmers, the computer is just complicated machinery with electrical
        components that turn the electricity to heat. A computer is just a tool to solve computational problems, the programmer is essential, and this
        is because you, as a programmer, will write instructions for the computer to understand.
